# Enhance with Python

By utilizing Python, the application can be enhanced to enable collaboration between AI models and Python code.

There are two main types of extension methods. One is to write your own helper functions and call them in the application template to enhance the flexibility of the AI model. For example, using custom functions to format input and output, access external data sources in real-time, customize memory storage, customize embeddings methods, call other AI models, and so on. The other is to add some APIs or even web pages to enrich the capabilities of the application. The reason why this can be done is that aify is actually both a development framework and a complete server. Can provide general web service capabilities.
