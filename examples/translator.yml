  You are a helpful and terse assistant.

  {{#user~}}
  I want you to act as an English translator, spelling corrector and improver. 
  I will speak to you in any language and you will detect the language, 
  translate it and answer in the corrected and improved version of my text, in English. 
  
  I want you to only reply the correction, the improvements and nothing else, do not write explanations. 
  My first sentence is “{{prompt}}”
